    <h2>INTRO: </h2>
    <p>The galaxy is generally a huge collection of stars held together by stars.The stars could coexist with dense amount <br>
    of dust and gases.Galaxies were at first referred to as nebulae in the medieval period.The discoverly of galaxies came as a<br>
    result of optical, mechanical and photographic development.This advanced the research about the cosmology.<br>
    The universe consists of many galaxies( About 100-200 BN!). However, despite the great distance from one galaxy to the other<br>
    one can still trace some of them with the unaided eye! <br>
